Small javascrip library containing methods to use in financial technical analysis of time series.
It is intended to be a simple library, for most of the methods the input is just an array of values to get as output 
another array.

Currently available methods are:

- Series min, max, mean and standar deviation.
- Moving Average of n-th order.
- Bollinger Bands (window n, k value).

For the testing part, fantastic qunit.js testing library is used.
Tests can be run from the file http://www.github.com/figurebelow/trendyways/tests.html once you get the 
repository
