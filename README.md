Small javascrip library containing methods to use in financial technical analysis of time series.
It is intended to be a simple library, for most of the methods the input is just an array of values to get as output 
another array.

Currently available methods are:

- Series min, max, mean and standar deviation.
- Moving Average of n-th order.
- Bollinger Bands (window n, k value).
- Pivot Line, resistances (R1, R2 and R3) and supports (S1, S2 and S3).

For the testing part, fantastic qunit.js testing library is used.
Tests can be run from the file tests.html once you fetch this
